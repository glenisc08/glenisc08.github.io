        <h1>Welcome to Momo's world! üê±</h1>
        <p>Meet Momo, a lovable grump with a heart of gold. At 2 years old, this feline foodie has already mastered the
          art of eating and sleeping. I've been lucky enough to be Momo's human since he was just a tiny 2-week-old
          kitten.
          Momo once had a sister named Luna, who sadly is no longer with us. Her memory lives on in our hearts, and Momo
          carries on their shared legacy of cuteness and mischief.
          Despite life's challenges, including a touch of asthma, Momo keeps on purring (and grumbling). Join us as we
          navigate the ups and downs of life with a cat who's equal parts sass and sweetness. Expect plenty of nap
          updates, meal-time shenanigans, and the occasional wheeze.
          Here's to Momo ‚Äì proving that sometimes, the grumpiest cats make the best companions!"</p>

        <p>Hello there! Nice to meet you, I'm Glenis. :3
          Welcome to my first web project - a page all about my beloved cat! I created this site as I'm learning web
          development, and while I'm still figuring things out (and feeling a bit stressed!), I'm doing my best and
          excited to share.
          Here you'll find photos and stories about my furry friend. Want to see some cute cat pics? Just click around!
          I'm still learning, so things might not be perfect, but I'm proud of what I've made so far.
        </p>
        <p>Into discussing topics like odd cat behaviors, pet care tips, & training tricks? Leave a comment! I LOVE
          reading your opinions & stories!!! I've learned so much already from working on this project, and I can't wait
          to learn more from visitors like you.
          Thanks for stopping by and being part of my learning journey!</p>

      <p>Momo is a special furry friend who came into my life when he was just two weeks old. Unlike many pet stories, I didn't choose Momo - he chose me. Curious about his story? You can read all about it here on this site.
        When I first started this page, I only had Momo. I was (and still am) obsessed with cats, so I figured I might as well start a web page exclusively about him.
        I'm new to web development, and this is my first project. I was a bit nervous about starting it, but with the way things were going - me constantly talking about Momo to anyone who would listen - I thought I might as well create a dedicated space for all things Momo. That was my line of thinking when I started this site.
        It's been challenging as I'm still learning, but my love for Momo and excitement about sharing his story keeps me motivated. From his grumpy expressions to his love for food and naps, there's always something interesting to share about my furry friend!</p>
      <img src="./imagenes/9.jpg" class="rounded mx-auto d-block img-fluid" alt="...">
      <p>A lot of what I post on here are things no one besides other cat owners will appreciate: pet care & healthcare advice, training tips, reviews of cat toys and litter, my experiences with the cat furniture and litter boxes I‚Äôve bought ‚Äì things like that.

        The rest are posts I feel all cat lovers, whether they‚Äôve got cats or not, will be interested in browsing through. Facts about felines, stories about cats, photo dump roundups of kitties in exceptionally cute ‚Äúposes;‚Äù things I‚Äôve always enjoyed looking at, sharing, and writing, though I‚Äôd gotten to the point where I needed to house these posts somewhere besides my personal blog, since it became dangerously close to being completely overrun by pictures of Avery.
        
        To be fair, I still post a lot about him (and now the other cats well) on there, though less, definitely, less! I‚Äôm an addict, what can I say üòâ</p>

      <h2>Asthma in Cats: Momo's Story</h2>
      <p class="text-center">Cats, like Momo, can have asthma. It's a condition that makes breathing difficult due to inflamed airways. Symptoms include wheezing and coughing.
        For Momo, asthma means extra naps and occasional wheezes during playtime. With proper care, he still enjoys his favorite activities - eating and sleeping! Through Momo's journey, we're learning to manage feline asthma and give our grumpy but lovable cat the best care possible.</p>

        <div class="text-center">
        <img src="./imagenes/10.jpg" class="rounded" alt="...">
        <h3>Thanks for visiting Momo's corner of the internet!</h3>
        <img src="./imagenes/14.jpg" class="rounded" alt="...">
        <p>We hope you enjoyed getting to know our grumpy but lovable furball. Remember, behind every cat nap is a story, and behind every meow is a personality. Keep following for more of Momo's adventures, asthma updates, and general cat-titude!
          Until next time, may your days be filled with purrs and your laps never empty.
          Catch you on the next cat nap! üò∫üí§</p>
